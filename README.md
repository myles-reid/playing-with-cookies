## Lessons Learned

Learning how to manipulate and work with cookies and their respective
strings. Some of the more complicated items was figuring out how to 
get the cookies I wanted with a ```getCookies()``` function, and its respective
regEx. 

Overall, this was not a complicated project to work on.
